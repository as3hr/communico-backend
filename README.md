## üåü Features

1. **Real-Time Communication**  
   - Powered by **Socket.IO** for low-latency real-time messaging and interactions.

2. **RESTful APIs**  
   - Node.js and Express.js provide a robust framework for building scalable APIs.

3. **Database Integration**  
   - PostgreSQL as the primary database for structured and reliable data storage.

4. **Containerization and Networking**  
   - **Docker** and **Docker Compose** ensure consistent environments and efficient networking.

5. **Reverse Proxy**  
   - **Nginx** configured as a proxy for secure and optimized routing.

6. **Automated Deployment**  
   - CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment process to virtual machines (VMs).

1. **Frameworks and Tools**  
   - **Node.js** with **Express.js** for backend APIs.
   - **TypeScript** for type-safe and maintainable code.

2. **Real-Time Communication**  
   - Implemented using **Socket.IO** for WebSocket-based interactions.

3. **Database**  
   - **PostgreSQL** for efficient relational data management.

4. **Containerization**  
   - **Docker** and **Docker Compose** to manage the application and database in isolated containers.

5. **Reverse Proxy**  
   - Configured **Nginx** for load balancing and request routing.

6. **CI/CD Pipeline**  
   - Automated deployment pipeline for continuous integration and delivery to VMs.
